# Vision-Guided-Robotic-Arm
A semi-autonomous, vision-guided robotic arm built using Python (Tkinter, OpenCV) and Arduino (with Adafruit PWM Servo driver). This system lets you manually or automatically control a 3DOF robotic manipulator to detect and grab black-colored cube-shaped objects using a USB camera feed.
